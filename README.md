# MES Simulation (FEM Simulation)
The repository contains complete software code that allow simulation of transient thermal processes using the finite element method.

It contains three main folders:
1. MES2.0 - the project contains files responsible for FEM calculations,
2. MesGUI - the project contains files responsible for graphic user interface,
3. Setup - the project contains files responsible for the MES Simulation software installer.
